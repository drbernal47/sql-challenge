Homework assignment about SQL

In this assignment we practiced creating table schemata for a database consisting of six CSV files. Included in this repo is an ERD that demonstrates the relationship between these six different tables.

In the "tables.sql" file the table schemata shows how each table is created.

In the "queries.sql" file, several queries are shown that correspond to the assignment's requested queries.
